# ADR 002:Location-Based Sharding Strategy

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Linksphere is expected to handle a wide range of read operations for posts. Since availability is a matter,this leads to shard the post database to ensure fast processing for queries.

After evaluating location based (based on user loaction ) and user ID based , we have decided to adopt a **location based sharding** to meet these requirements.

## Decision

We will use a **location based sharding** for the social networking platform so the retrival of data is easier when .

## Consequences

- Complex cross-region queries (e.g., global search)
- Increased operational overhead
- Index Management: Each shard maintains its own indexes

### Benefits

- 40-60% latency reduction for regional users
- Independent scaling per region
- Natural disaster resilience

## Conclusion

The **microservices architecture** is the best choice for our social networking platform due to its scalability, fault isolation, and flexibility. While it introduces additional complexity and operational overhead, the long-term benefits of independent development, deployment, and scaling justify the decision.
