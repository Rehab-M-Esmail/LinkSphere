# ADR 001: Using MongoDB and PostgreSQL in a Social Networking Platform

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Our social networking platform will manage structured data (e.g., user profiles, relationships, posts) and unstructured data (e.g., media files, activity logs, real-time notifications).

Given the diverse nature of the data and the need for high performance, we need to decide whether to use a single type of database (SQL or NoSQL) or a combination of both. After evaluating the options, we have decided to use **PostgreSQL** for structured data and **MongoDB** for unstructured data.

## Decision

We will use **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB** in our social networking platform, leveraging the strengths of each to optimize performance, scalability, and flexibility.

### PostgreSQL (SQL Database)

- **Use Case**: Structured data such as user profiles, relationships, posts, comments, and metadata.
- **Examples**:
  - Storing user profiles with fields like name, email, and date of birth.
  - Managing friend relationships, follower networks, and group memberships.
  - Storing posts, comments, and their metadata (e.g., timestamps, likes).

### MongoDB (NoSQL Database)

- **Use Case**: Unstructured or semi-structured data such as media files, activity logs, real-time notifications, and cached data.
- **Examples**:
  - Storing media files (images, videos) and their metadata.
  - Managing real-time notifications and messaging.
  - Caching frequently accessed data to reduce latency.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Optimized Performance**: PostgreSQL excels at handling structured data with complex queries, while MongoDB is optimized for high-speed read/write operations and unstructured data.
- **Scalability**: MongoDB’s horizontal scaling capabilities make it ideal for handling large volumes of unstructured data and high traffic loads.
- **Flexibility**: MongoDB’s schema-less design allows for easy adaptation to changing data requirements, while PostgreSQL ensures data integrity and consistency for critical structured data.

### Trade-offs

- **Complexity**: Managing two different databases increases system complexity. We will need to implement robust data synchronization and integration mechanisms.
- **Operational Overhead**: Maintaining and monitoring both PostgreSQL and MongoDB will require additional resources and expertise.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **PostgreSQL Only**: Using only PostgreSQL would simplify the architecture but would limit our ability to handle unstructured data efficiently and scale for high traffic.
2. **MongoDB Only**: Using only MongoDB would provide scalability and flexibility but would lack the strong consistency and complex querying capabilities needed for structured data.
3. **NewSQL**: Exploring NewSQL databases (e.g., CockroachDB, TiDB) that aim to combine the benefits of SQL and NoSQL. However, these technologies are still evolving and may not yet offer the maturity and ecosystem support we need.

## Conclusion

Using **PostgreSQL** for structured data and **MongoDB** for unstructured data allows us to leverage the strengths of each database, optimizing performance, scalability, and flexibility. While this approach introduces additional complexity and operational overhead, the benefits outweigh the trade-offs for our specific use case.
