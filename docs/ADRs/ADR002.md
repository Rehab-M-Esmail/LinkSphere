# ADR 002: Choosing Microservices Architecture for the Social Networking Platform

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Linksphere is expected to handle a wide range of functionalities, including user management, post creation, real-time notifications, media storage, and more. As the platform grows, we need an architecture that can scale efficiently, support independent development and deployment, and ensure fault isolation.

After evaluating monolithic and microservices architectures, we have decided to adopt a **microservices architecture** to meet these requirements.

## Decision

We will use a **microservices architecture** for the social networking platform, breaking down the application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### Key Characteristics of Microservices Architecture

- **Decentralized**: Each microservice is a self-contained unit with its own database (if needed) and business logic.
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently, allowing for faster iteration and reduced risk.
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand.
- **Technology Agnostic**: Different services can use different technologies (e.g., programming languages, databases) as needed.
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service are less likely to impact the entire system.

### Example Microservices for the Platform

1. **User Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. **Post Service**: Manages the creation, editing, and retrieval of posts and comments.
3. **Media Service**: Handles the storage and retrieval of media files (images, videos).
4. **Notification Service**: Manages real-time notifications and messaging.
5. **Relationship Service**: Manages friend relationships, follower networks, and group memberships.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently based on its workload, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service (e.g., Notification Service) do not affect the entire platform.
- **Independent Development**: Teams can work on different services simultaneously, enabling faster development cycles.
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use the most appropriate technology stack for their specific needs.
- **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, focused codebases are easier to maintain and debug.

### Trade-offs

- **Complexity**: Microservices introduce additional complexity in terms of service communication, data consistency, and deployment.
- **Operational Overhead**: Managing multiple services requires robust DevOps practices, including monitoring, logging, and orchestration.
- **Latency**: Inter-service communication (e.g., via APIs or message queues) can introduce latency compared to a monolithic architecture.
- **Data Management**: Maintaining data consistency across services can be challenging, especially in distributed transactions.

## Conclusion

The **microservices architecture** is the best choice for our social networking platform due to its scalability, fault isolation, and flexibility. While it introduces additional complexity and operational overhead, the long-term benefits of independent development, deployment, and scaling justify the decision.
